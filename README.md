Program:	**Tic Tac Toe Game**

This TicTacToe game repository contains source files, executables and test files. \
Source: \
	- Game.h			->		Header file containing TicTacToe Game class declaration
	- Game.cpp			->		File containing TicTacToe Game class implementation
	- TicTacToeGame.cpp	->		File containing the main method where the code begins
Test: \
	- GameTest.cpp		->		File containing Unit test for the TicTacToe Game class

Assumptions: \
	- The game is always 3x3
	- Player 'X' always starts the game
	- Players can't overwrite opponents moves
	- Players take turns alternatively unless an invalid move is made in which they have to play until the move becomes valid

Provisions: \
	As mentioned in the document, the code is modular without any GUI. The 'get' and 'move' methods can be used to interact with any game interface. (Have also mentioned in the class declaration comments)
